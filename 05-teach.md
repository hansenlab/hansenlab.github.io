I am a co-director of the [Genomic Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/genomic-data-science) specialization, where I teach [Bioconductor for Genomic Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/learn/bioconductor).

Bioconductor Book

I have written [Bioconductor](https://leanpub.com/bioconductor), _an introduction to core technologies_.  It is available for free (see link) but you can also buy (donate).
