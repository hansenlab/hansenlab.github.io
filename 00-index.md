Overview
--------

I am an assistant professor in the
[McKusick-Nathans Insitute of Genetic Medicine](http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/geneticmedicine) and
the [Department of Biostatistics](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu) at Johns Hopkins University.  I am
part of the [Center for Computational Biology](http://ccb.jhu.edu).

Research Interests
------------------

I am interested in computational biology, especially the analysis of high-throughput biological
data.  Biological areas of special interest are epigenetics (particular DNA methylation), gene
expression, and biases in high-throughput technologies.

During my postdoc I focused on developing methodology for analyzing next-generation sequencing data,
with emphasis on bisulfite sequencing.  I have applied this methodology to study DNA methylation in
cancer.  I have also worked on normalizing RNA sequence data.

During my Ph.D. I analyzed various custom microarrays, used for the study of alternative splicing as
well as bacteria detection.  I also worked on biases in RNA sequencing.

Biography
---------

I received my Ph.D. in Biostatistics with a Designated Emphasis in Computational and Genomic Biology
in 2009 from University of California, Berkeley under the supervision of
[Sandrine Dudoit](http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/users/sandrine).  My thesis was titled "Some analyses
of high-throughput expression data".

Prior to obtaining my Ph.D., I received my Master's degree in statistics from the University of
Copenhagen in 2001.  I subsequently worked approximately two years as a research assistant at the
[Department of Biostatistics](http://www.biostat.ku.dk), University of Copenhagen.

After my Ph.D. I did a post doc at the Department of Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins, supervised by
[Rafael Irizarry](http://rafalab.jhsph.edu).
