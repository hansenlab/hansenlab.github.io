Overview
--------

The Hansen lab is led by Kasper Daniel Hansen.

The lab is associated with the
[McKusick-Nathans Insitute of Genetic Medicine](http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/geneticmedicine) and
the [Department of Biostatistics](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu) at Johns Hopkins University.  We are
part of [Center for Computational Biology](http://ccb.jhu.edu).

Research Interests
------------------

We are a computational biology lab, interested in analysis of high-throughput experiments.  Areas of
special interest are epigenetics (particular DNA methylation), gene expression, and biases in
high-throughput technologies.

A **selection** of current topics in the lab:

- Understanding selective pressures on chromatin in humans
- RNA velocity in single cells
- Ultra-large (200,000+ samples) scale analysis of RNA-seq data
- Using genetic techniques to understand epigenetics by studying Mendelian disorders of the epigenetic machinery
- Analysis of DNA methylation and other epigenetic marks using Nanopore sequencing
