Overview
--------

TEST

The Hansen lab is led by Kasper Daniel Hansen.

The lab is associated with the
[McKusick-Nathans Insitute of Genetic Medicine](http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/geneticmedicine) and
the [Department of Biostatistics](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu) at Johns Hopkins University.  We are
part of [Center for Computational Biology](http://ccb.jhu.edu).

Research Interests
------------------

We are a computational biology lab, interested in analysis of high-throughput experiments.  Areas of
special interest are epigenetics (particular DNA methylation), gene expression, and biases in
high-throughput technologies.
